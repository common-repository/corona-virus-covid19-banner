Comply with new South African Covid-19 regulations requiring all websites ending in .ZA to show a link to the official government page. This adds a discrete banner.

== Description ==

As of 26 March 2020, a new regulation (see reference below) was created in South Africa, requiring all websites operating within the .za top level domain name to have a landing page with a visible link to www.sacoronavirus.co.za.
This plugin will make you 100% compliant with the new regulation by adding a discrete, styled banner on the bottom right-hand side of the page which includes the link to the Department of Health's official Covid-19 page.

Once installed you can also customise the banner from the plugin's setting page. The following features are available with many more to follow:
1. Customise font and background colours to fit in with your website's colour palette
2. Customise the text that appears in the banner
3. Include a link to help others add the banner to their own websites
4. Select pages on your website where you don't want the banner to appear
